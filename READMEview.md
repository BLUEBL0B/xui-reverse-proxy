### Proxy using VLESS-TCP-XTLS-Vision and VLESS-TCP-REALITY (Steal oneself) behind reverse-proxy NGINX
This script is designed to quickly and easily set up a hidden proxy server, with masking via NGINX. In this variant, all incoming requests are handled by NGINX, and the server acts as a proxy server only if the request contains the correct path (URI). This increases security and helps to hide the true purpose of the server.
